# Sort Visualizer
I built this Sorting Algorithm Visualizer after watching [Clement Mihailescu 's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXYym4Wbkc&t=405s) on Sorting Visualizer.
This is a [progressive web app](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) which is built using React.
Visualize classic sorting algorithms such as Selection sort, merge sort etc.

The main challange I found is to find two points in between which I want to sort and track those(according to the different algorithms), because we need to change color and value (height of bar) for visualize the Sorting.

## To be implemented
- Add a dropdown menu to all sort and Generate New Array button to sort.
- Implement Different Sorting Algorithms and Visualization functions.
- Get huge help from [Clément Mihailescu's git repo](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Sorting-Visualizer-Tutorial)

## Notes
- For every Sorting Visualizer, I am using two comparisions.
- When I am comparing 2 bars first I change their color to red and again need to change to original color.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
